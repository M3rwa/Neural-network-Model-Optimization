## Introduction

Neural network models have become increasingly popular in various domains, but they often require optimization to improve their performance, efficiency, and generalization capabilities. This repository aims to provide practical examples and insights into optimizing neural network models using different techniques and strategies.

The notebooks cover a wide range of optimization techniques, including but not limited to:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Regularization methods (e.g., L1 and L2 regularization)
- Dropout regularization
- Early stopping
- Model ensembling
- Model quantization

Each notebook focuses on a specific optimization technique and provides detailed explanations, code examples, and demonstrations of its impact on the model's performance.

## Notebooks

The following notebooks are available in this repository:

1. [Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering](data-preprocessing-and-feature-engineering.ipynb)
2. [Hyperparameter Tuning](hyperparameter-tuning.ipynb)
3. [Regularization Techniques](regularization-techniques.ipynb)
